In order for the RTBox to work with your computer, you need to have an FTDI driver installed for OS X 10.9+ and the FTDI USB Serial driver installed


How to get FTDI driver installed for OS X:

1. Unplug all FTDI devices

2. If you have OS X 10.11+, you need to disable the System Integrity Protection in OS X.
	- Boot into Recovery OS by restarting your machine and holding down the Command and R keys at startup.
	- Go into utilities > terminal
	- Enter the following commands:
		csrutil disable
		reboot

3. From OS X 10.9 and onwards, Apple has installed its own FTDI driver, and it needs to be disabled.  Now that System Integrity Protection is disabled, enter in the following commands:
	cd ~/../../System/Library/Extensions
	sudo mv AppleUSBFTDI.kext AppleUSBFTDI.disabled
This will disable Appleâ€™s custom FTDI driver

4. If on OS X 10.11+, reenable System Integrity Protection for security.  Boot into Recovery OS, open terminal, and enter the following commands:
	csrutil enable
	reboot

5. Download and install the FTDI VCP driver from the link below:
